# Prerequisites for Week 2 Seminars and Labs (CS5701/02)

The following is the *minimum* you need to do to be ready for, and get the most out of the Week 2 Seminars and Labs for CS5701 and CS5702.

1. <span style="color: darkorange;">**A working version of R and RStudio**</span>  
    - **Alternative**: (i) Use [Horizon](https://intra.brunel.ac.uk/news/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3108ABE2-B772-4B43-A109-D392735C9C2F%7D&file=Horizon%2520User%2520Guide%2520v1.2.docx&action=default) which provides remote access to Brunel lab PCs  
    - **Alternative**: (ii) Use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) or see [here](https://bookdown.org/martin_shepperd/ModernDataBook/C1-UsingRStudio.html) for a guide; it requires you to set up a free account    
    - **Help**: (i) Have another go at installing this software - check out the Modern Data guide [here](https://bookdown.org/martin_shepperd/ModernDataBook/W0-Prep.html#C0_SoftwareInstall) or a 2 min [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/d-u_7vdag-0)
    - **Help**: (ii) RStudio maintains a Troubleshooting and Support [website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200488508-RStudio-Desktop-Will-Not-Start)  
2. <span style="color: darkorange;">**Understand the basic functionality of RStudio such that you can open, edit and save a file plus create a new file**</span>  
    - **Help**: (i) Read the [Getting Ready chapter](???) or if you are in a great rush the [Install and test R and RStudio](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/5259/access) subsection
    - **Help**: (ii) A [short video](https://www.loom.com/share/f0ecbbbc17dc43acbcdf9deb5fb22f3c) by Martin showing the basics of RStudio 
3. <span style="color: darkorange;">**Understand the basics of RMarkdown and how to embed and run R code within it**</span>  
    - **Help**: (i) A video showing the [RMarkdown basics](https://www.loom.com/share/13100c7fb0ef4e9cb453e1ed12ac73c8) or revisit Section 2 of the [Week 1 worksheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjshepperd/CS5702-Data/master/CS5702_W1_Lab.Rmd) Worksheet.
