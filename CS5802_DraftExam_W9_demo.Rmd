Work sent via email will not be marked.  
2. You should upload a *single answer file* (as an RMarkdown file) based on **this** Exam Template containing your answers which will be a mix of text and R code.  
3. When you save your notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).  There is no need to upload any rendered HTML or PDF files.  
4. Do not edit the YAML header (lines 1-7) except to replace xxx with your student id.  
5. Write your answers using RMarkdown.  For guidance see a [helpful blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-markdown-guide-cheatsheet/#tve-jump-17333da0719) or use the R Markdown cheatsheet which can be accessed from within RStudio by selecting `Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Quick Reference`.

    -- Answer here  


 
ii) What data type is `x`? **(2 MARKS)**

```{r}
# Do not edit this code
x <- c("a", "", NA, "d")
```


iii) Edit `x` so that it comprises the letters "a", "b", "c", "d".  Output the new contents. **(2 MARKS)**

```{r}
# Add your code to update x below

```

```{r}
# Create y and z
y <- c(4:1)
z <- seq(0,6,2)
# Add your code to create my.df below

## Section II: Quantitative Data Analysis

**Question 4:**

See the output from a correlation test between two variables speed and distance below:


	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  cars$speed and cars$dist
t = 9.464, df = 48, p-value = 1.49e-12
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.6816422 0.8862036
sample estimates:
      cor 
0.8068949 


i) What can you conclude about the correlation between speed and distance? **(2 MARKS)**

-- Answer here  

ii) Explain how you would visualise in a graph the relationship between these two variables? **(4 MARKS)**
