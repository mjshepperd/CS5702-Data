## Exam instructions  

1. Uploads need to be **COMPLETED** before the end of the upload time.  Late work will not be accepted.  If you have any problems uploading work you must notify us that you are experiencing difficulties in uploading and/or submitting your work, using the contact details you have been given (in exam "Live Chat" or phone 01895 268860).  Work sent via email will not be marked.  
2. You should upload a *single answer file* (as an RMarkdown file) based on **this** Exam Template containing your answers which will be a mix of text and R code.  
3. When you save your notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).  There is no need to upload any rendered HTML or PDF files.  
4. Do not edit the YAML header (lines 1-7) except to replace xxx with your student id.  
5. Write your answers using RMarkdown.  For guidance see a [helpful blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-markdown-guide-cheatsheet/#tve-jump-17333da0719) or use the R Markdown cheatsheet which can be accessed from within RStudio by selecting `Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Quick Reference`.  
6. If you wish you can obtain a formatted view of this exam template and your answers by using the Preview button in RStudio.  
7. You may *not* communicate with other candidates nor share information/discuss exam-related matters with any external person for the duration of the exam.  

## Exam rubric

1. This section (SECTION B) comprises one question containing sub-questions.  You should attempt *all* sub-questions.  
2. The allocated marks are indicated for each sub-question.  There is a total of 100 marks.  
3. Note that no sub-question 'belongs' to either CS5701 or CS5702 so you are encouraged to draw on any relevant material.  
4. This is an OPEN BOOK exam.  
5. The end of the exam is delimited by "*****END OF EXAM*****".    

By continuing beyond this point, you confirm that you have read the information and instructions above and understand the conditions of this examination.

## Section B: Data analysis question (Total 100 marks)

**Question B1: Data quality checking (Total 25 marks)**

You have been presented with a new data set based on survivors from the SS Totemic.  The data are organised by class of passenger (or crew member), their sex, whether the person was an adult or child and frequency counts for survivors / non-survivors, represented as separate rows.  (NB The Totemic is the imaginary sister ship to the Titanic and bizarrely was involved in a similar incident when she carelessly crashed into another iceberg and rapidly sunk.  Be aware that these are distinct data sets.)

```{r}
# Run this code to load the Totemic data set as a data frame Totemic
# as part of Q2
remoteFileName <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjshepperd/CS5702-Data/master/Totemic.RData"
load(file = url(remoteFileName))
head(Totemic)
```

B1i) Describe in a **list** the various checks you will make to the Totemic data set to determine the data quality.  Be specific, i.e., don't just say check the data are valid!  Make sure you include checks that are passed (i.e., do not restrict yourself to checks that identify problems).  **(10 MARKS)**

> Add your answer here



B1ii) Implement your checks in R. Use comments and meaningful variable names.  **(10 MARKS)**

```{r}
# Add your data cleaning code here for Q2(ii)

```



B1iii) Summarise the results of your quality analysis of the Totemic data set clearly indicating all the problems you have identified.  **(5 MARKS)**

> Add your answer here




**Question B2: Data cleaning (Total 25 marks)**


etc, etc



**Question B3: Data cleaning (Total 25 marks)**

B3i) Suppose naval historians wish to understand the difference, if any, between male and female survival rates.  Produce relevant descriptive statistics and visualisations to help the historians. **(15 MARKS)**


etc etc



*****END OF EXAM*****

```{r}
# Add your data cleaning code here for B3i

```


B3ii) What test would you suggest to investigate if there are statistically sigificant differences between the male and female survival rates?  Justify your answer.  Implement your approach in R.  **(10 MARKS)**

> Add your answer here


```{r}
# Add your code for B3ii
